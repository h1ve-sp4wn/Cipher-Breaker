Build the Docker Image

Navigate to your project directory and build the Docker image with the following command:

    docker build -t cipher-breaker .

This command will create a Docker image tagged as cipher-breaker.

Step 6: Run the Docker Container

After the image is built successfully, you can run the container with this command:

    docker run cipher-breaker

This will execute your Python script inside the container. The output will be displayed in your terminal.
